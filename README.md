pecek
====================
pecek discovers the Minimal Download Strategy (MDS) in SharePoint 2013. The original solution is from Chris O'Brien's blog:

- [Using JSLink to change the UI of a SharePoint list/view](http://www.sharepointnutsandbolts.com/2013/01/using-jslink-to-change-ui-of-sharepoint_20.html)

In his blog Chris mentions an issue with JSLink and MDS. I want to find a solution for this issue and learn more about MDS. I will even write a blog post about it.
The goal is to change Chris' original solution as little as possible to find the essential solution for MDS and custom javascript.
