This project will contain some sharepoint samples, like 101 sp samples, very isolated. 

sp-lend-id.taprat
=================
Taprat is an powershell cmdlet for activating sharepoint features with the ability of specifiing properties. Details on [my blog](http://sharepointkunskap.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/creating-custom-powershell-cmdlet/).

ikkelen
==================
Ikkelen is a small SharePoint project which illustrates the ability to provision same javascript-intensive webparts multiple times on the same page.
Details on my blog: [Multiple instances of javascript webparts on the same page](http://sharepointkunskap.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/multiple-instances-of-javascript-webparts-on-the-same-page/).

aran-aran
====================
aran-aran is a collection of powershell scripts.

pecek
====================
pecek discovers the Minimal Download Strategy (MDS) in SharePoint 2013. The original solution is from Chris O'Brien's blog:

- [Using JSLink to change the UI of a SharePoint list/view](http://www.sharepointnutsandbolts.com/2013/01/using-jslink-to-change-ui-of-sharepoint_20.html)

In his blog Chris mentions an issue with JSLink and MDS. I want to find a solution for this issue and learn more about MDS. I will even write a blog post about it.
The goal is to change Chris' original solution as little as possible to find the essential solution for MDS and custom javascript.
