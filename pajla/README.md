Pajla (/pajla/, in Chuvash it means "to part, to divide") is a little script for exporting any webpart from a SharePoint page. The exported WebPart is an XML definition of a webpart that can be uploaded to a Web Parts gallery or used directly when provisioning webparts in SSOM, CSOM, in frameworks like SPMeta2 and PnP.

More information can be found on my blog: [Export Any Web Part using a Bookmarklet](http://chuvash.eu)

The bookmarklet is minified and prepared using the ["bookmarkleter"](http://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/)
