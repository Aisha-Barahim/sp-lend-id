Aran-Aran. PowerShell Scripts
----------------------------

This is a collection of PowerShell scripts which I have written for several needs. 

The name aran-aran [аран-аран] [/aranaran/](http://www.forvo.com/word/%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD/#cv) means *little by little* in Chuvash. 

Pull-Documents
==============
This script gets all the files from a document library and saves them on hard disk. See [my blog](http://chuvash.eu/2012/12/11/powershell-copy-an-entire-document-library-from-sharepoint-2007-to-disk/) for more details.

Migrate-Choices
==============
The script migrates all the possible values from a field choice to a termset. It uses Client Object Model to get the values from a FieldChoice and the server object model to write them to the target environment. See my blog for more details.
